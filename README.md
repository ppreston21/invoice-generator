# Invoice Automation System

This project automates the process of generating and sending invoices via email. The system consists of two Python scripts:

1. **`invoice-generator.py`**: This script reads sales data from a CSV file and generates PDF invoices grouped by sales order. The invoices are saved in the specified directory.
2. **`email-step.py`**: This script allows the user to select an invoice by entering its number, then sends the invoice via email to the corresponding client using Gmail's SMTP service.

### Key Features:
- **Automated Invoice Generation**: Create professional PDF invoices directly from your sales CSV data.
- **Personalized Emailing**: Send the generated invoices to clients with personalized messages.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Minimal user input required; simply input the invoice number, and the system takes care of the rest.



invoice-generator.py


Sales order grouping: The data is grouped by Sales order, so multiple purchases by the same client will appear on a single invoice.
Invoice formatting: The generate_invoice function now loops through all items associated with a given sales order and lists them with descriptions and amounts.
Y-axis management: The Y position for drawing strings (y_position) decreases for each new item so that multiple items are properly spaced.

To Run:
Make sure the CSV file path is correct (sales-orders.csv).
Run the script and check if the print statements appear, indicating the PDF generation process.
Check the invoices folder in your project directory for the generated PDF files.

email-step.py

Key Details:
Input:
The script requests the invoice number (e.g., 00-001) from the user.
Client Information:
It uses pandas to fetch the Client Name and Email from the sales CSV to personalize the email.
Email Setup:
MIMEMultipart allows you to format the email with both text and attachments.
The PDF file is attached to the email.
SMTP for Gmail:
Connects to Gmailâ€™s SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com on port 587).
Logs in with the sender's email and password to send the email.
Important: If you use two-factor authentication (2FA) on your Gmail account, you'll need to generate an app password instead of using your regular password.
Steps to Run:
Fill in the sender's email and password:

Replace "your_email@gmail.com" and "your_password" in the script with your Gmail credentials.
Prepare CSV:

Ensure your sales-orders.csv is present in the same folder or specify the correct path.
Check Output:

The script will check if the corresponding invoice file (invoice_00-001.pdf) exists.
If found, it will send the email with the attached invoice.
Run the script.
