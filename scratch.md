invoice-generator.py


Sales order grouping: The data is grouped by Sales order, so multiple purchases by the same client will appear on a single invoice.
Invoice formatting: The generate_invoice function now loops through all items associated with a given sales order and lists them with descriptions and amounts.
Y-axis management: The Y position for drawing strings (y_position) decreases for each new item so that multiple items are properly spaced.

To Run:
Make sure the CSV file path is correct (sales-orders.csv).
Run the script and check if the print statements appear, indicating the PDF generation process.
Check the invoices folder in your project directory for the generated PDF files.
